this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as

## Standards

This section describes the standards we will try to maintain in this repo.

### Commit Messages

All commit messages should follow
[these best practices](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), specifically:

- Start with a subject line
- Contain a body that explains _why_ you're making the change you're making
- Reference an issue number if one exists, closing it if applicable (with text
  such as
  ["Fixes #245" or "Closes #111"](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/))

Aim for [2 paragraphs in the body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjmw9TRB7s).
Not sure what to put? Include:

- What is the problem being solved?
- Why is this the best approach?
- What other approaches did you consider?
- What side effects will this approach have?
- What future work remains to be done?

### Coding standards

The code in this repo should follow best practices, specifically:

- [Go code review comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)

## Finding something to work on

Thanks so much for considering contributing to our project!! We hope very much
you can find something interesting to work on:

- To find issues that we particularly would like contributors to tackle, look
  for
  [issues with the "help wanted" label](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
- Issues that are good for new folks will additionally be marked with
  ["good first issue"](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
